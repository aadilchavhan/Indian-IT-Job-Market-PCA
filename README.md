# **Dimensionality Reduction in IT Job Market Analysis: Applying PCA for High-Paid Roles in India**  

## **Overview**
This project applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to analyze **high-paid IT jobs in India**, reducing dimensionality while retaining critical salary-related insights. By applying PCA, we aim to simplify complex datasets and extract meaningful trends that impact salaries in the IT industry.

## **Dataset Information**
- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle: IT Job Market Salary Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashutosh598/position-salary-dataset/data)  
- The dataset consists of records related to **high-paid IT professionals in India**, including details such as:
  - **Position** – IT job roles (Software Engineer, Data Scientist, etc.)
  - **Location** – Work setting (Remote/On-Site)
  - **Gender** – Male/Female classification
  - **Education** – Degree qualifications of professionals
  - **Experience (Years)** – Total years of work in the industry
  - **Salary** – Current annual salary of individuals

## **Objective**
- Utilize **PCA** to **reduce dataset complexity** while retaining meaningful insights into salary trends.  
- Identify **high-paying IT job roles** and their correlation with **experience, education, and job location**.  
- Enhance career planning insights for IT professionals looking to optimize their salary potential.  

## **Tools & Libraries**
This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Scikit-learn** for PCA implementation  

## **Key Findings**
- **Experience and education** are crucial factors in determining **high salaries in IT jobs**.  
- **Data Scientists and Software Engineers** consistently rank among the **highest-paid roles** in the industry.  
- **Remote job opportunities** show **salary variations** based on skill specialization.  
- PCA effectively reduced dataset dimensions while **preserving salary distribution patterns** for better visualization.  
- **Technical expertise** contributes significantly to salary gaps **more than location-based differences**.
